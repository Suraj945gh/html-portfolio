</p>

<p>‚û°Ô∏è Beyond the classroom, you'll find me paintingüé®, readingüìñ. It quenches my thirst of knowledge and 
  upthrusts my curiousity. I believe that exploring my interests outside of academics is essential to achieving a 
  well-rounded education and having out-of-box thinking. And who knows, we might even discover some common ground 
  and shared passions!</p>

  achieve great things and make a difference in the world .</p>
