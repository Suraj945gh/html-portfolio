<h1>The Best Movies according to Suraj</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mission Mangal</h3>
<p>This movie is about India's quest to launch a module to space which goes to Mars and give us 
   valuable information about it. Despite ISRO's failure earlier , it reiterated and turmoiled 
   very hard to achieve this feat and India became one of the nations who could send its satellite
   to Mars in record budget which was less than the hollywood's movie 'Gravity' </p>
<h3>Super 30</h3>
<p>The story hails from an ambition of an Indian boy who wanted to go Harvad University and he did receive
    an offer letter too , but due to odd times and his father's demise , he didn't go . But this led him to
    the foundation of Super 30 - a batch of 30 students , whom he taught the curriculum of the entrance exams
    IIT JEE and all these students were poor but were ambitious enough . Their passion led them in clearing the
    most difficult entrance exams of India and they entered into IITs
</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>This is a thriller film produced by Christopher Nolan which talks about the life of Robert . J. Oppenheimer
    , who was a scientist who changed the world with his theory on atom bombs. The film fantasizes about his 
    quest for producing a chain reaction that would probably not stop ever and would destroy the world ! This 
    film goes deeper into his political and social life and his contradictions with Lewis Strauss , who was then
    found guilty and was arrested.
